# Nostr is Not a Social Media Protocol

It is common for people to say that Nostr is a social media protocol, like ActivityPub or Secure Scuttlebutt, but this is a serious mistake.

Nostr has the potential to eliminate the barriers and guard-rails that social media imposes upon online social interaction.
If things go well, Nostr will help humanity transcend the confines of social media.

### Disintermediating Online Social Interaction

Nostr could become the foremost means of online social interaction outside of the state-sanctioned social media platforms.

Nost has no use for network effects.

### Revolutionizing internet technologies

Nostr is capable of revolutionizing a large number of internet technologies unrelated to social interaction.
JSON-RPC (incorrectly called REST) is used in a wide range of software: Bitcoin Core, Gmail, Facebook, Twitter, and ActivityPub to name a few.
