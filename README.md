# nostr-stuff
This repo contains documents on Nostr that I'm in the process of writing. As such, all of these documents are drafts/incomplete.
I plan to eventually publish these elsewhere. But I'm putting them here in case someone might find them useful prior to formal publication.

The general theme for these documents is my assertion that Nostr is not a social media protocol.
I aim to explore the frontier of Nostr (which is itself a frontier) where social media is not present.
